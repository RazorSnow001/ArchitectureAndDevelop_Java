CompletableFuture

A CompltableFuture is used for asynchronous programming

Asynchronous programming means writing non-blocking code

It runs a task on a separate thread than the main application thread

notifies the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.

In this way, the main thread does not block or wait for the completion of the task. Other tasks execute in parallel. Parallelism improves the performance of the program.

It performs an action and returns a value when another completion stage completes.

A model for a task that may trigger other tasks.

A CompletableFuture is an extension to Java's Future API which was introduced in Java 8.

Future has so many limitations, that's why we have CompletableFuture.
CompletableFuture provides a broad set of methods for creating multiple Futures, chaining, and combining.
 It also has comprehensive exception handling support

 Creating a CompletableFuture

 CompletableFuture<String> CompletableFuture = new CompletableFuture<String>();

 Initially, Java had locks (via synchronized classes and methods), Runnables and
Threads. In 2004, Java 5 introduced the java.util.concurrent package, which supported more expressive concurrency, particularly the ExecutorService1
 interface
(which decoupled task submission from thread execution), as well as Callable<T>
and Future<T>, which produced higher-level and result-returning variants of Runnable
and Thread and used generics (also introduced in Java 5). ExecutorServices can execute both Runnables and Callables. These features facilitated parallel programming
on the multicore CPUs that started to appear the following year. To be honest, nobody
enjoyed working with threads directly
